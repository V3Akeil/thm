1st Step is to run nmap to discover services and open ports

2nd step is visiting the website which gave a hint that each user can access his/her page using the codename which is the agent and some letter ex: Agent A. So I used curl command with the header of User-Agent and tried letters until I got that C shows us user chris with a message that his password is weak. So, we bruteforced ftp using hydra with his user and got the password "crystal". "curl "ip" -H "User-Agent: C" -L"

3rd step is to download the files in the ftp server which contains a text message for user james indicating that his password is embedded in the images so we used stegseek and binwalk to get the password from a zip file that was in one of the images and we cracked the password of the zip using john to get the password of james which is "hackerrules!"

4th step is we tried to find any privillege escalation vector and we did using sudo -l where we found that there is the vulnerability CVE-2019-14287 which is exploited when we execute this command "sudo -u#-1 bash"
