1st Step is scanning the IP address using nmap and gobuster

2nd Step is determining the versions of the services on the machine

3rd Step is to use "wpscan --url (ip) -e u" to check for the version of the CMS which came to be Wordpress 5.0 that is vulnerable to Crop Image smt exploit using metasploit and to enumerate for users 

4th Step is we initiated a dictionary attack using "wpscan --url (ip) -U (text file of users or just type the user) -P (password dictonary)"

5th Step is use the exploit to gain access and then cat the config file to find a password which came to be for bjoel.

6th step is we start enumeration using automated tools such as linpeas which helped us to find an uncommon SUID binary file called checker in /usr/sbin. By using ghidra, we found the main function which looks if the env variable admin is admin then we get uid as 0 which is root so we did "export admin=admin" and ran checker to get root access" Note*** I got in a rabbit hole when scanning for services and found the smb running for Billy. user.txt was in /media/usb
